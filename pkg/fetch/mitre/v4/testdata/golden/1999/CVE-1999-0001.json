That one is related\nto nestea (CVE-1999-0257) and probably the one described in\nBUGTRAQ:19981023 nestea v2 against freebsd 3.0-Release\nThe patch for nestea is in ip_input.c around line 750.\nThe patches for CVE-1999-0001 are in lines 388&446.  So, \nCVE-1999-0001 is different from CVE-1999-0257 and CVE-1999-0052.\nThe FreeBSD patch for CVE-1999-0052 is in line 750.\nSo, CVE-1999-0257 and CVE-1999-0052 may be the same, though\nCVE-1999-0052 should be RECAST since this bug affects Linux\nand other OSes besides FreeBSD.",
