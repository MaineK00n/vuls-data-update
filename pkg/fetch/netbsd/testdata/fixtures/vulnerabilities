# Please read "Handling packages with security problems" in the pkgsrc
# guide before editing this file.
#
# Note: NEVER remove entries from this file; this should document *all*
# known package vulnerabilities so it is entirely appropriate to have
# multiple entries in this file for a single package, and to contain
# entries for packages which have been removed from pkgsrc.
#
# New entries should be added at the end of this file.
#
# Please ask pkgsrc-security to update the copy on ftp.NetBSD.org after
# making changes to this file.
#
# The command to run for this update is "./pkg-vuln-update.sh", but it needs
# access to the private GPG key for pkgsrc-security.
#
# If you have comments/additions/corrections, please contact
# pkgsrc-security@NetBSD.org.
#
# Note: If this file format changes, please do not forget to update
# pkgsrc/mk/scripts/genreadme.awk which also parses this file.
