Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.The specific flaw exists within the iMailGatewayService server process (ECTrace.dll) which listens for encrypted requests by default on TCP port 993 (IMAP) and port 587 (SMTP). The process fails to properly sanitize malformed user string inputs before passing to the authentication logging function. A format string vulnerability exists in the Sybase OneBridge server and DMZ agent. Failed exploit attempts will likely result in a denial-of-service condition. \nNOTE (June 3, 2011): This BID was previously titled 'Sybase OneBridge Server and DMZ Proxy Unspecified Security Vulnerability'; it has been updated to better reflect the nature of the vulnerability. \nAuthentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. \n\n-- Vendor Response:\nSybase has issued an update to correct this vulnerability.
