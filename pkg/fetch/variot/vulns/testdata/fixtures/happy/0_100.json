user from a virtual machine guest to potentially crash the host system via local access. Intel Has released an update for each product.The expected impact depends on each vulnerability, but can be affected as follows: * Service operation interruption (DoS) * information leak * any WebGL Code execution. Intel Graphics Driver is prone to a remote code-execution vulnerability and a denial-of-service vulnerability. \nSuccessfully exploiting these issues may allow an attacker to execute  arbitrary code in the context of affected application or cause  denial-of-service conditions. \nIntel Graphics Driver versions prior to 10.18.x.5056 (aka 15.33.x.5056), 10.18.x.5057 (aka 15.36.x.5057) and 20.19.x.5058 (aka 15.40.x.5058) are vulnerable. Unified Shader Compiler is one of those compilers. A remote attacker can use a specially crafted shader file to exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service (system crash). \nCVE-2019-8787: Steffen Klee of Secure Mobile Networking Lab

There are no workarounds to mitigate these\nvulnerabilities other than disabling H.323 on the vulnerable device. \n\nThis advisory is posted at \nhttp://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20100922-h323.shtml\n\nNote:  The September 22, 2010, Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory\nbundled publication includes six Cisco Security Advisories. Five of\nthe advisories address vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software, and one\nadvisory addresses vulnerabilities in Cisco Unified Communications\nManager. Each advisory lists the releases that correct the\nvulnerability or vulnerabilities detailed in the advisory. The table\nat the following URL lists releases that correct all Cisco IOS\nSoftware vulnerabilities that have been published on September 22,\n2010, or earlier:\n\nhttp://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20100922-bundle.shtml\n\nIndividual publication links are in \"Cisco Event Response: Semiannual\nCisco IOS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication\" at the\nfollowing link:\n\nhttp://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/Cisco_ERP_sep10.html\n\nAffected Products\n=================\n\nThese vulnerabilities only affect devices that are running Cisco IOS\nSoftware with H.323 voice services enabled. \n\nVulnerable Products\n+------------------\n\nCisco devices that are running affected Cisco IOS Software versions\nthat are configured to process H.323 messages are affected by these\nvulnerabilities. H.323 is not enabled by default. \n\nTo determine if the Cisco IOS Software device is running H.323\nservices, issue the show process cpu | include H323 command, as shown\nin this example:\n\n    Router# show process cpu | include H323\n     249       16000           3       5333  0.00%  0.00%  0.00%   0 CCH323_CT\n     250           0           1          0  0.00%  0.00%  0.00%   0 CCH323_DNS\n    Router#\n\nIn the previous example the processes CCH323_CT and CCH323_DNS are\nrunning on the device; therefore, the device is listening to H.323\nmessages. The device is vulnerable if any of these processes (or\nsimilar) are active. \n\nNote: Creating a dial peer by issuing the dial-peer voice command\nwill start the H.323 processes, which causes the Cisco IOS device to\nprocess H.323 messages. \n\nTo determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a\nCisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the\nshow version command to display the system banner. The system banner\nconfirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying\ntext similar to \"Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software\" or\n\"Cisco IOS Software.\" The image name displays in parentheses,\nfollowed by \"Version\" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other\nCisco devices do not have the show version command or may provide\ndifferent output. \n\nThe following example identifies a Cisco product that is running\nCisco IOS Software Release 12.3(26) with an installed image name of\nC2500-IS-L:\n\n    Router# show version\n    Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software\n    IOS (tm) 2500 Software (C2500-IS-L), Version 12.3(26), RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc2)\n    Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport\n    Copyright (c) 1986-2008 by cisco Systems, Inc. \n    Compiled Mon 17-Mar-08 14:39 by dchih\n\n\n    !--- output truncated\n\n\nThe following example identifies a Cisco product that is running\nCisco IOS Software Release 12.4(20)T with an installed image name of\nC1841-ADVENTERPRISEK9-M:\n\n    Router# show version\n    Cisco IOS Software, 1841 Software (C1841-ADVENTERPRISEK9-M), Version 12.4(20)T,\n        RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc3)\n    Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport\n    Copyright (c) 1986-2008 by Cisco Systems, Inc. \n    Compiled Thu 10-Jul-08 20:25 by prod_rel_team\n\n\n    !--- output truncated\n\n\nAdditional information about Cisco IOS Software release naming\nconventions is available in \"White Paper: Cisco IOS Reference Guide\"\nat the following link: \nhttp://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html\n\nProducts Confirmed Not Vulnerable\n+--------------------------------\n\nCisco IOS XR Software is not affected by these vulnerabilities. \n\nNo other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these\nvulnerabilities. \n\nDetails\n=======\n\nH.323 is the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) standard for\nreal-time multimedia communications and conferencing over\npacket-based (IP) networks. A subset of the H.323 standard is\nH.225.0, a standard that is used for call signaling protocols and\nmedia stream packetization over IP networks. An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities\nremotely by sending crafted H.323 packets to an affected device that\nis running Cisco IOS Software. A TCP three-way handshake is required\nto exploit these vulnerabilities. \n\nThese vulnerabilities are documented in Cisco Bug IDs CSCtc73759 (\nregistered customers only) and CSCtd33567 ( registered customers\nonly) , and have been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\n(CVE) IDs CVE-2010-2828 and CVE-2010-2829, respectively. \n\nVulnerability Scoring Details\n=============================\n\nCisco has provided scores for the vulnerabilities in this advisory\nbased on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS\nscoring in this Security Advisory is done in accordance with CVSS\nversion 2.0. \n\nCVSS is a standards-based scoring method that conveys vulnerability\nseverity and helps determine urgency and priority of response. \n\nCisco has provided a base and temporal score. Customers can then\ncompute environmental scores to assist in determining the impact of\nthe vulnerability in individual networks. \n\nCisco has provided an FAQ to answer additional questions regarding\nCVSS at\n\nhttp://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/cvss-qandas.html\n\nCisco has also provided a CVSS calculator to help compute the\nenvironmental impact for individual networks at\n\nhttp://intellishield.cisco.com/security/alertmanager/cvss\n\nCSCtc73759 - Device crashing upon receipt of specific traffic\n\nCVSS Base Score - 7.8\nAccess Vector           Network\nAccess Complexity       Low\nAuthentication          None\nConfidentiality Impact  None\nIntegrity Impact        None\nAvailability Impact     Complete\n\nCVSS Temporal Score - 6.4\nExploitability          Functional\nRemediation Level       Official Fix\nReport Confidence       Confirmed\n\nCSCtd33567 - Traceback seen when receiving crafted H.323 packets\n\nCVSS Base Score - 7.8\nAccess Vector           Network\nAccess Complexity       Low\nAuthentication          None\nConfidentiality Impact  None\nIntegrity Impact        None\nAvailability Impact     Complete\n\nCVSS Temporal Score - 6.4\nExploitability          Functional\nRemediation Level       Official Fix\nReport Confidence       Confirmed\n\nImpact\n======\n\nSuccessful exploitation of the vulnerabilities described in this\nadvisory may cause the affected device to reload. Theses\nvulnerabilities could be exploited repeatedly to cause an extended\nDoS condition. \n\nSoftware Versions and Fixes\n===========================\n\nWhen considering software upgrades, also consult \nhttp://www.cisco.com/go/psirt and any subsequent advisories to \ndetermine exposure and a complete upgrade solution. \n\nIn all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the\ndevices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current\nhardware and software configurations will continue to be supported\nproperly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact\nthe Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted\nmaintenance provider for assistance. \n\nEach row of the following Cisco IOS Software table corresponds to a\nCisco IOS Software train. If a particular train is vulnerable, the\nearliest releases that contain the fix are listed in the First Fixed\nRelease For This Advisory column. The First Fixed Release for All\nAdvisories in the September 2010 Bundle Publication column lists the\nearliest possible releases that correct all the published\nvulnerabilities in the Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory bundled\npublication. Cisco recommends upgrading to the latest available\nrelease, where possible. \n\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\n|   Major    |             Availability of Repaired Releases         |\n|  Release   |                                                       |\n|------------+-------------------------------------------------------|\n|  Affected  |                           |  First Fixed Release for  |\n| 12.0-Based |  First Fixed Release for  |   All Advisories in the   |\n|  Releases  |       This Advisory       |   September 2010 Bundle   |\n|            |                           |        Publication        |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| There are no affected 12.0-based releases                          |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|  Affected  |                           |  First Fixed Release for  |\n| 12.1-Based |  First Fixed Release for  |   All Advisories in the   |\n|  Releases  |       This Advisory       |   September 2010 Bundle   |\n|            |                           |        Publication        |\n|------------+---------------------------+---------------------------|\n|            |                           | Vulnerable;

Applying\naccess lists on interfaces that should not accept H.323 traffic and\nplacing firewalls in strategic locations may greatly reduce exposure\nuntil an upgrade can be performed. \n\nCisco provides Solution Reference Network Design (SRND) guides to\nhelp design and deploy networking solutions, which can be found at\nhttp://www.cisco.com/go/srnd Voice Security best practices are\ncovered in the Cisco Unified Communications SRND Based on Cisco\nUnified Communications Manager 6.x at \nhttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/voice_ip_comm/cucm/srnd/6x/security.html\n\nTo disable all H.323 call processing, administrators can issue the\ncall service stop forced command under the voice service voip mode,\nas shown in this example:\n\n    voice service voip\n     h323\n      call service stop forced\n\nNote: The call service stop forced command disables all H.323 call\nprocessing. \n\nAdditional mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices within\nthe network are available in the companion document \"Cisco Applied\nMitigation Bulletin: Identifying and Mitigating Exploitation of the\nMultiple Vulnerabilities in Cisco Voice Products\", which is available\nat the following location: \nhttp://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-amb-20100922-voice.shtml\n\nObtaining Fixed Software\n========================\n\nCisco has released free software updates that address these\nvulnerabilities. Prior to deploying software, customers should\nconsult their maintenance provider or check the software for feature\nset compatibility and known issues specific to their environment. \n\nCustomers may only install and expect support for the feature sets\nthey have purchased. By installing, downloading, accessing or\notherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to be bound\nby the terms of Cisco's software license terms found at \nhttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html\nor as otherwise set forth at Cisco.com Downloads at \nhttp://www.cisco.com/public/sw-center/sw-usingswc.shtml\n\nDo not contact psirt@cisco.com or security-alert@cisco.com for\nsoftware upgrades. \n\nCustomers with Service Contracts\n+-------------------------------\n\nCustomers with contracts should obtain upgraded software through\ntheir regular update channels. For most customers, this means that\nupgrades should be obtained through the Software Center on Cisco's\nworldwide website at http://www.cisco.com\n\nCustomers using Third Party Support Organizations\n+------------------------------------------------\n\nCustomers whose Cisco products are provided or maintained through\nprior or existing agreements with third-party support organizations,\nsuch as Cisco Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers\nshould contact that support organization for guidance and assistance\nwith the appropriate course of action in regards to this advisory. \n\nThe effectiveness of any workaround or fix is dependent on specific\ncustomer situations, such as product mix, network topology, traffic\nbehavior, and organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected\nproducts and releases, customers should consult with their service\nprovider or support organization to ensure any applied workaround or\nfix is the most appropriate for use in the intended network before it\nis deployed. \n\nCustomers without Service Contracts\n+----------------------------------\n\nCustomers who purchase direct from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco\nservice contract, and customers who purchase through third-party\nvendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through\ntheir point of sale should acquire upgrades by contacting the Cisco\nTechnical Assistance Center (TAC). TAC contacts are as follows. \n\n  * +1 800 553 2447 (toll free from within North America)\n  * +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)\n  * e-mail: tac@cisco.com\n\nCustomers should have their product serial number available and be\nprepared to give the URL of this notice as evidence of entitlement to\na free upgrade. Free upgrades for non-contract customers must be\nrequested through the TAC. \n\nRefer to \nhttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html\nfor additional TAC contact information, including localized telephone\nnumbers, and instructions and e-mail addresses for use in various \nlanguages. \n\nExploitation and Public Announcements\n=====================================\n\nThe Cisco PSIRT is not aware of any public announcements or malicious\nuse of the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. \n\nThese vulnerabilities were found during Cisco internal testing. \n\nStatus of this Notice: FINAL\n============================\n\nTHIS DOCUMENT IS PROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS AND DOES NOT IMPLY ANY\nKIND OF GUARANTEE OR WARRANTY, INCLUDING THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR USE.
