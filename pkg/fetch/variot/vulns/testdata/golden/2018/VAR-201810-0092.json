		"data": "Denial of Service in Unified Shader Compiler in Intel Graphics Drivers before 10.18.x.5056 (aka 15.33.x.5056), 10.18.x.5057 (aka 15.36.x.5057) and 20.19.x.5058 (aka 15.40.x.5058) may allow an unprivileged user from a virtual machine guest to potentially crash the host system via local access. Intel Has released an update for each product.The expected impact depends on each vulnerability, but can be affected as follows: * Service operation interruption (DoS) * information leak * any WebGL Code execution. Intel Graphics Driver is prone to a remote code-execution vulnerability and a denial-of-service vulnerability. \nSuccessfully exploiting these issues may allow an attacker to execute  arbitrary code in the context of affected application or cause  denial-of-service conditions. \nIntel Graphics Driver versions prior to 10.18.x.5056 (aka 15.33.x.5056), 10.18.x.5057 (aka 15.36.x.5057) and 20.19.x.5058 (aka 15.40.x.5058) are vulnerable. Unified Shader Compiler is one of those compilers. A remote attacker can use a specially crafted shader file to exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service (system crash). \nCVE-2019-8787: Steffen Klee of Secure Mobile Networking Lab
