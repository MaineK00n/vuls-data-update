Microsoft is not aware of any active attacks leveraging this vulnerability. The following offerings are affected:&nbsp; </div><div> </div><div><ul><li>Azure Confidential Computing VM SKU DCasv5/DCadsv5&nbsp; </li><li>Azure Confidential Computing VM SKU ECasv5/ECadsv5&nbsp; </li><li>Azure Confidential Computing VM SKU NCC40ads_H100_v5&nbsp; </li> </ul> </div><div> </div><div> </div><div> </div><div> </div><div>&nbsp; </div><div> </div><div>As of January 27, 2025, a microcode update has been applied to our AMD-based Azure Confidential Computing clusters which will protect customers from this vulnerability. </div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; </div><div> </div><div>To update the confidential VM attestation workflow to reflect the patch status, a system BIOS update is required. Microsoft is in the process of developing and deploying a BIOS update to these Azure Confidential Computing clusters, which will require a reboot.&nbsp; Customers will be notified of the time window to initiate the BIOS update via Azure Service Health portal, and if they do not self-initiate it, Microsoft will subsequently initiate the update, which will force a reboot.&nbsp;&nbsp; </div><div><br> </div><div> </div><div>Microsoft is not aware of any active attacks leveraging this vulnerability. Microsoft continues working closely with industry partners, including AMD, to protect our customers.&nbsp; </div><div><br> </div><div> </div><div><b>Recommendation</b>. Microsoft recommends that Azure Confidential Computing customers self-initiate the BIOS update when they receive an alert in the Azure Service Health Portal for their AMD-based Azure Confidential VMs.&nbsp; </div><div> </div><div>&nbsp; </div><div> </div><h2>Advisory FAQ&nbsp; </h2><div> </div><div><b>Will the delay in developing a BIOS update expose my organization to exploits by threat actors?&nbsp;&nbsp;</b> </div><div><b><br></b> </div><div> </div><div>No. A microcode update has been applied to the confidential computing services hosting customer workloads, which will protect against future run time attacks leveraging this vulnerability. Microsoft is not aware of any active attacks leveraging this vulnerability. Microsoft continues working closely with industry partners, including AMD, to protect our customers.&nbsp; </div><div> </div><div>&nbsp; </div><div> </div><div><b>Are Microsoft services built on Azure Confidential Computing mitigated against this vulnerability?&nbsp;</b> </div><div><b><br></b> </div><div> </div><div>Yes. We have applied the microcode update to mitigate the vulnerability in the immediate term. To update the confidential VM attestation workflow to reflect the patch status, a system BIOS update is required. Microsoft is in the process of developing and deploying the BIOS update to Azure Confidential Computing clusters, which will require a reboot.&nbsp; </div><div> </div><div>&nbsp; </div><div> </div><div><b>How will Azure Confidential Computing customers be notified about the BIOS update, once it is available?&nbsp;</b> </div><div><b><br></b> </div><div> </div><div>The Azure Service Health Portal. More info is available here: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/virtual-machines/maintenance-notifications-portal\">Use the portal for maintenance notifications - Azure Virtual Machines | Microsoft Learn</a>.&nbsp; </div><div> </div><div>&nbsp; </div><div> </div><div><b>Are there more actions required for customers to be protected against this vulnerability? (What can my organization do to protect itself?)&nbsp;</b> </div><div><b><br></b> </div><div> </div><div>No. We have applied the microcode update to mitigate the vulnerability in the immediate term.&nbsp; For attestation results after the Microcode update, confidential VM (CVM) customers can fetch SNP attestation report to validate the Microcode patch status from the current TCB. Once Microsoft has deployed the BIOS update, customers will be able to verify that update has been applied via remote attestation. &nbsp; </div><div> </div><div>&nbsp; </div><div> </div><div><b>How can I confirm the microcode update through attestation?&nbsp;</b> </div><div><b><br></b> </div><div> </div><div>By using the SNP attestation report fetched within Confidential VMs running on the system where microcode is applied. The “currentTCB” value within the report indicates the updated microcode version. Here are the steps to get the SNP attestation report to check the TCB version - <a href=\"https://github.com/Azure/cvm-attestation-tools/blob/main/cvm-attestation/How_to_read_attestation_report.md\">Reading the TCB Version from SNP Attestation Report</a>&nbsp; </div><div> </div><div>&nbsp; </div><div> </div><h2>Disclaimer&nbsp; </h2><div> </div><div>The information provided in this advisory is provided &quot;as is&quot; without warranty of any kind.
