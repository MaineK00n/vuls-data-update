Please make sure the package builds successfully at least for Fedora Rawhide.

- If the build failed for unrelated reasons (e.g. temporary network
  unavailability), please ignore it.
- If the build failed because of missing BuildRequires, please make sure they
  are listed in the "Depends On" field

    <thetext>Spec sanity
===========

I've tried adding this:

  BuildRequires:  /usr/bin/node
  ...
  %prep
  ...
  # Problem with tests reported
  # https://github.com/y-crdt/ypy-websocket/issues/62
  # Workaround:
  sed -i '0,/@pytest.fixture/{s/@pytest.fixture/import pytest_asyncio\n@pytest_asyncio.fixture/}' tests/conftest.py


But the tests still fail with:

  node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1042
    throw err;
    ^
  
  Error: Cannot find module 'yjs'
  Require stack:
  - /builddir/build/BUILD/ypy_websocket-0.8.2/tests/yjs_client_1.js
      at Module._resolveFilename (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1039:15)
      at Module._load (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:885:27)
      at Module.require (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1105:19)
      at require (node:internal/modules/cjs/helpers:103:18)
      at Object.&lt;anonymous&gt; (/builddir/build/BUILD/ypy_websocket-0.8.2/tests/yjs_client_1.js:1:11)
      at Module._compile (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1218:14)
      at Module._extensions..js (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1272:10)
      at Module.load (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1081:32)
      at Module._load (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:922:12)
      at Function.executeUserEntryPoint [as runMain] (node:internal/modules/run_main:81:12) {
    code: 'MODULE_NOT_FOUND',
    requireStack: [ '/builddir/build/BUILD/ypy_websocket-0.8.2/tests/yjs_client_1.js' ]
  }


This makes me think the comment in %check should be:

  %check
  # test_ypy_yjs.py requires https://www.npmjs.com/package/yjs
  %pytest --ignore=tests/test_ypy_yjs.py


And the @pytest_asyncio.fixture problem is moot.

----

&gt; BuildRequires:  python3-pytest
&gt; BuildRequires:  python3-pytest-asyncio
&gt; BuildRequires:  python3-websockets

There is a [test] extra, but it also has mypy and pre-commit. I suggest working with upstream to split mypy and pre-commit to a lint extra and autogenerate the tests dependencies. If not worth your time (which frankly probably isn't), let's add a comment above those BRs so others know why they are manual instead, please.

The spec is sane.
