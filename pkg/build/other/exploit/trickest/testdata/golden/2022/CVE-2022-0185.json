{"id":"CVE-2022-0185","exploit":{"trickest":{"description":" A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the legacy_parse_param function in the Filesystem Context functionality of the Linux kernel verified the supplied parameters length. An unprivileged (in case of unprivileged user namespaces enabled, otherwise needs namespaced CAP_SYS_ADMIN privilege) local user able to open a filesystem that does not support the Filesystem Context API (and thus fallbacks to legacy handling) could use this flaw to escalate their privileges on the system.","poc":{"reference":["https://www.willsroot.io/2022/01/cve-2022-0185.html"],"github":["https://github.com/ARPSyndicate/cvemon","https://github.com/Ch4nc3n/PublicExploitation","https://github.com/Crusaders-of-Rust/CVE-2022-0185","https://github.com/EGI-Federation/SVG-advisories","https://github.com/Metarget/metarget","https://github.com/Mr-xn/Penetration_Testing_POC","https://github.com/arveske/Github-language-trends","https://github.com/bigpick/cve-reading-list","https://github.com/binganao/vulns-2022","https://github.com/bsauce/kernel-exploit-factory","https://github.com/bsauce/kernel-security-learning","https://github.com/chenaotian/CVE-2022-0185","https://github.com/chenaotian/CVE-2022-25636","https://github.com/discordianfish/cve-2022-0185-crash-poc","https://github.com/featherL/CVE-2022-0185-exploit","https://github.com/hac425xxx/heap-exploitation-in-real-world","https://github.com/hardenedvault/ved","https://github.com/hktalent/TOP","https://github.com/joydo/CVE-Writeups","https://github.com/khaclep007/CVE-2022-0185","https://github.com/nestybox/sysbox","https://github.com/nestybox/sysbox-ee","https://github.com/nomi-sec/PoC-in-GitHub","https://github.com/shahparkhan/cve-2022-0185","https://github.com/veritas501/CVE-2022-0185-PipeVersion","https://github.com/veritas501/pipe-primitive","https://github.com/xairy/linux-kernel-exploitation"]}}}}
