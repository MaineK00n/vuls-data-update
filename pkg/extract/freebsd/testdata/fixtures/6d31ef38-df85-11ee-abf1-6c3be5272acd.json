All other users need to be\n\t  explicitly granted permission to create a data source, which then means they\n\t  could exploit this vulnerability.</p>\n\t  <p>When a user creates a data source via the\n\t  <a href=\"https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/developers/http_api/data_source/#create-a-data-source\">API</a>,\n\t  they can specify data source UID. If the UID is set to an asterisk (*),\n\t  the user gains permissions to query, update, and delete all data sources\n\t  in the organization. The exploit, however, does not stretch across\n\t  organizations â€” to exploit the vulnerability in several organizations, a user\n\t  would need permissions to create data sources in each organization.</p>\n\t  <p>The vulnerability comes from a lack of UID validation. When evaluating\n\t  permissions, we interpret an asterisk (*) as a wild card for all resources.\n\t  Therefore, we should treat it as a reserved value, and not allow the creation\n\t  of a resource with the UID set to an asterisk.</p>\n\t  <p>The CVSS score for this vulnerability is\n\t  <a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L&amp;version=3.1\">6 Medium</a>.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n\t"
