				"title": "CVE-2018-8014 tomcat: Insecure defaults in CORS filter enable 'supportsCredentials' for all origins (moderate)",
				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: The MITRE CVE dictionary describes this issue as: The defaults settings for the CORS filter provided in Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.8, 8.5.0 to 8.5.31, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.52, 7.0.41 to 7.0.88 are insecure and enable 'supportsCredentials' for all origins. It is expected that users of the CORS filter will have configured it appropriately for their environment rather than using it in the default configuration. Therefore, it is expected that most users will not be impacted by this issue. \n            \n            MITIGATION: When using the CORS filter, it is recommended to configure it explicitly for your environment.  In particular, the combination of `cors.allowed.origins = *` and `cors.support.credentials = True` should be avoided as this  can leave your application vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS). For details on configuring CORS filter, please refer to https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/config/filter.html#CORS_Filter",
